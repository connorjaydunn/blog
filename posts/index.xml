      <description>This article details the steps I took to discover and exploit an SQL injection vulnerability on the Clemson University website using my own tool, SQLiF (SQL injection Finder).&#xA;DISCLAIMER This post and the release of my tool, SQLiF, are intended for educational purposes only. I was previously granted permission from Clemson University to document and share my findings with others. I am not responsible for anything you do with the information presented within this post.</description>
